```N_Realisations```  - Number of Realizations, read from ReadIn file \
``` LengthScale```  - Length Scale for correlation function, read from ReadIn File \
``` Eigen Precent``` - Cut-off percentage for singular values, read from ReadIn file \
``` E ``` - Scaling factor for standard deviation (bump)function\
``` disp ``` - Displacement of center of standard deviation (bump) function 
``` power ``` - Power of standard deviation (bump) function (flatness of bump) \
### Declared in code
```N_U``` - Velocity degree of freedom \
```N_P``` - Pressure degree of freedom
